Banshees are considered to be the most empathetic of the [[Wraith|Shades]], and the ones most driven by insight and emotions. Many are compassionate, but some of the more cynical ones become prone to judging others who might be considered worthy of their assistance. Caregiver, Gallant, and Penitent are examples of natures Banshees tend to exhibit.
