A Caern is a sacred place to the [[Garou]], where they can meet among themselves and make contact with the [[Spiritual Realm|spirit realms]]. A desecrated caern is called a "[[Pit]]", and [[Black Spiral Dancers]] caerns are referred to as "[[Pit|Hive]]s".
# Overview
---
A caern is a location that has a natural upwelling of [[Investiture|Gnosis]]. Caerns also have a very thin veil, allowing easier congress between the [[Physical Realm|physical world]] and the [[Cognitive Realm|Umbra]]. It's possible that a caern's Gnosis actually comes from the Umbra in this fashion.

Caerns often feel as if they have their own personalities, which stems from the demeanor of the beings that tend them, and from the spirits drawn to them. Packs and their [[Spirits#Patron Spirits|Patron]] makeups, the spiritual attendants, and the physical circumstances all do much to make a caern unique.

Caerns are extremely holy sites to the Garou and to many other [[Fera]], and they will work to their utmost to claim and protect them. Occasionally, this will mean claiming it from another group who isn't looking after it responsibly.
