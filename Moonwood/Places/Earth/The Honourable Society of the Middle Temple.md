The Middle Temple is one of the largest known library on [[London]], located near the [[River Thames]] and holding overapproximately 40,000 titles in 250,000 volumes, including legislation, case law, textbooks, student manuals, loose-leaf publications, journals and law reports. The Library is open to members of all four Inns of Court.
# Overview
---
A modern institution with a long and distinguished history, Middle Temple is a place of many parts.

First and foremost, Middle Temple is one of the four Inns of Court which have the exclusive right to Call students to the Bar. The education and training of advocates lie at the heart of the Inn, but we are also a professional society for our membership worldwide; and we maintain a heritage estate in central London housing chambers from which barristers practise.

Several important activities support Middle Temple’s core functions. In addition to teaching, training and the management of the Inn’s property portfolio, these include the provision of around £1 million per year in support of our students and other junior members; the running of a modern Law library and an historic archive; the oversight (with Inner Temple) of the historic Temple Church; and the management of a commercial events business.  All of these activities represent the 21st century Middle Temple, but training and education will always be at its core.
