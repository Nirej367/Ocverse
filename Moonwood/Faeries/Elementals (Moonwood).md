Elementals are one of the [[Lost]] They are the children of the earth, air and sky of Faerie; those born of the raw elements of nature itself.
# Overview
---
While most other [[Lost]] became the way they did through simply living in a [[Faerie]]'s home and eating faerie food and doing faerie work, the _Elementals_ were often deliberately changed, transformed into slaves of some kind or another, or features of the land until one day, they awoke to themselves and realized they had to escape.

Their memories of [[Faerie]] are often difficult to understand. Some know that once, they understood what it was to be a tree, or a stone, or a mound of earth. Some remember being lost to enchantment, becoming a clockwork doll or a lover made of ice. Others recall being lost in an environment now alien to them.

The Elementals were often those whom the [Fae](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Fae_\(CofD\) "Fae (CofD)") desired in some way, those whom they sought out and went to some effort to kidnap. Most were already exceptional in some way. Perhaps the changeling was beautiful enough to excite a faerie's desire. Perhaps they needed a guard or a servant of some kind. A musician or dancer could become the prize of a Fae who fancied himself a doyen of the arts. When they come back, they still possess those talents that attracted the Fae to them in the first place, but now their element alters it in many ways, some subtle, some less so. Some, however, wandered into the Hedge on their own, in some ways bearing the marks of whatever thorny wasteland they wandered in before being taken to Faerie.
## Elemental Blessing
---
Elementals, touched as they are by the stuff of the world, are able to channel the forces and materials that define them into their bodies, giving them an uncanny ability to shrug off physical harm. Once per day, the player can spend one point of Glamour to add the character's Wyrd rating to his Health dots for the rest of the scene. These follow the normal rules for temporary Health dots.
### Elemental Curse
---
The Elementals are further removed from humanity than other changelings, and find humans harder to understand and influence. An Elemental doesn't get the benefit of the 10 again rule on any dice pools involving the Manipulation Attribute and the Empathy, Expression, Persuasion or Socialize Skills.
