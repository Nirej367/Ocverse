A **Freehold** is a constructed place of [[Faerie|Fae]] power where They may rest free from the hold of Banality and disbelief.
# Overview
---
While there were, in the past, many natural sites called Glades where faerie magic existed in the world, Banality has eroded them over the centuries. The enchanted forests, sacred groves, and faerie rings are mostly gone, as are the great castles of the sidheand fortresses of the trolls. They have disappeared into the [[Mists]], hidden even from faerie sight, and the trods that once connected them to Arcadia lie closed by human disbelief. Some few places, though maintain their connections to the [[Moonwood|Dreaming]] and their [[Glamour]] or can be given such things.
