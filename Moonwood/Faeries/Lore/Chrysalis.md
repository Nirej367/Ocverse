The Chrysalis is the process by which a changeling becomes aware of their fae nature.
# Overview
---
Changelings are both born and made. Since undertaking the [[Changeling Way]], they are born in the bodies of human infants and spend the first part of their life as normal children. Many reach their teens and a few even full adulthood before the part of themselves that is of the Dreaming bursts out. This process, at whatever time of life it comes, is the Chrysalis
# Hints of the Dreaming
---
Throughout their lives, most Changelings grow up as misfits in their communities. Some indescribable essence hovers over them and causes others to label them as "gifted," "exceptional," "precocious," or even, appropriately, "fey." Some societies have more derogatory terms for such people. As children they have imaginary playmates who might not be imaginary. They insist on believing in dragons and unicorns and superheroes even after their peers have moved on to sports and dating. As they age they continue to strike their friends and families as eccentric or whimsical and fail to ever really feel comfortable in the world. This sense of not quite belonging comes from the sleeping [[Faerie]] soul, waiting its time to express itself.

Some changelings may experience a mini-Chrysalis, and reject it and return to their mundane states, only to re-experience the Chrysalis again much later in life.
# Dream Dance
---
At some point, usually the most inopportune time for the mortal life, the warnings stop and the high point of the Chrysalis begins: the **Dream Dance**. Like a natural disaster, [[Glamour]] rushes in to surround the awakened Changeling, wrapping him or her in the stuff of raw [[Moonwood|Dreaming]]. Nothing they experience has any relation to the world they thought they knew. They often have a hard time perceiving where their body and the rest of the world begins.

Confronted with the Dreaming for the first time, the Fae faces his or her true fae self in the light of chimerical reality. The [[Mists]] roll away, more or less, and visions of past lives and even distant Kerthalyss may come; visions of the future are possible as well. Their deepest dreams and nightmares come to bear. And the surge of Glamour announces to every fae in the area about what has just happened.

A Changeling is at their most vulnerable during the Dream Dance. Unable to make sense of what is happening, they become a beacon of mystical energy that any supernatural being has a chance to notice. He or she becomes easy prey to some, including those who hunt the fae. All changelings in the area are duty-bound to locate the new fae and protect him or her and most do, if only to drink from the wellspring of Glamour associated with the Dance.
# Madness
---
Not every changeling who experiences their Chrysalis can cope with it. Some plunge into madness as their world crumbles. Some take refuge in Banality and deny that anything is real about their new being; they would rather have "normal."
