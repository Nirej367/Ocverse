# Overview
---
The salamander is a tiny, deceptively agreeable creature resembling its amphibious namesake. It can withstand extreme heat, and when threatened, the salamander will ignite, creating a white-hot flame around its body.

Regardless, its skin is cool no matter how hot the temperature around it. The flaming salamander can be found in damp places or in woodpiles, although it has also been spotted near volcanoes. It gives off the odor of sulphur and is believed to secret poison so terrible that it burns whatever it touches. 

Salamanders are sought by alchemists because they are an integral component for turning lead into gold. They are also sought for their pelts, since the skins can be used to make flame-retardant gloves. Although swift, a salamander can be caught with tongs and kept in an iron box.
