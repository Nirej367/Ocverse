The Beasts are one of the [[Faerie|changeling]] seemings. They are the animal-blooded changelings who hunt in the tangled forests of Faerie, swim in its waters, soar in its skies, or pace in its kennels.
# Overview
---
Beasts are connected to the animal world. They come in many shapes and sizes, and may be tied to a particular type of animal, an animalistic concept, or even an animal that never existed in the real world. 

All of them were used by their [[Keepers]] as animals in one form or another, and they all bear at least some bestial features. Many were innocents, lured into the Hedge by the tempting excitement of the wild, but regardless, they felt the pull and power of raw instinct and sensation.
## Seeming Blessing
---
Beasts are blessed with a wild nature that gives them an affinity with animals and a raw, bestial attractiveness that they may use to gain favour with humans.
## Seeming Curse
---
This same animalism is also their curse,, however; their ties to instinct and the simpler thoughts of the animal world make it hard for them apply themselves to cerebral tasks unless they have had training in a specific area, and they are rarely able to access human levels of mental insight.
