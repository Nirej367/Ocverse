**Vampires** are one of the three main [[Supernatural]] beings in [[Moonwood]].
# Overview
---
The blood-drinkers who stalk [[Moonwood]] mostly call themselves Kindred licks, or Cainites. The term "vampire" seems déclassé to the habitués of Elysium and the theorists of Anarch utopia, reminiscent of cheesy Hammer sequels and tourist-friendly reactionary folklore. However, those [[Embrace|Embraced]] in recent decades increasingly use the term among themselves ("taking the v-word back"), establishing their claim to this status despite the thinness of their Blood.

To be a vampire is to be driven by an insensate [[Hunger]] for human blood and by the immortal legacy of your [[Vitae|vampire Blood]]. Hunger drives you to murderous frenzy, impels you to slake your thirst in mortal veins.

The human blood you drink alchemizes and resonates, granting not just ecstasy but also immortality; not just strange powers, but also slavery. More than most of us, vampires are what they eat. More than most of us, vampires must retain their humanity if they want to be more than that. **Humanity** is a measure of how closely a vampire clings to the morality and values of [[Humans|mortal]] life, and consequently how well they are able to resist the urges of the [[Beast]].
