The Spiritual Realm is the realm of existence that contains the essence or soul of things. In this Realm, the [[Connection|interconnection]] between objects, people, and ideals are made apparent. It is said to transcend form, thought, being, and self; it is merely a network of Connections between the truest form of all things. Within the Spiritual Realm, Magic takes on its most consistent form, and comprises everything within the Realm.

Everything has a Spiritual aspect, a soul, which represents the idealized form or concept upon which their existence is based. Among sentient creatures, this soul is sometimes described as a [[Spiritweb]].
