**Mokolé** are werelizards and werecrocodilians, descendants of the prehistoric [[Lizard Kings]] and one of the surviving [[Fera|changing breeds]].

# Overview

The Mokolé serve the role of the memories of [[Gaia]] through the practice of [[Mnesis]]. There are no surviving turtle or tortoise Mokolé, and the snake varnas are now [[Nagah]]. During the Age of Kings, the Mokolé Lizard Kings were the dominant shifter species on Earth, until the event they call the "Wonder-Work" arrived and changed all that. Their society never truly recovered and later they were nearly wiped out by the [[Garou]] during the [[War of Rage]]. Although they can be very social with their own kind, these shapeshifters are generally distrustful towards outsiders because of this troublesome history,

A trait that all Mokolé share is the Mnesis ability, which allows them to remember thousands to millions of years into the past. All Mokolé inherit knowledge of the language of the dragons, even if they have no other Mnesis. The _Dragon’s Tongue_ was the common language of the Earth during the Age of Kings. Most could read and write its elaborate script as well. Many old-fashioned Mokolé refer to it as "the Speech" and will refuse to admit that "rat's chitter" is capable of fluent expression.

Mnesis brings knowledge of the Speech when a new Mokolé dreams her shape. If the newly Changed one has never heard the Dragon's Tongue, she will understand it but be hesitant to speak until she has heard more. The Speech can be written phonetically, but is more often written using the original claw-print script. In classic tales, hand and body motions accompany the speech. 

Mokolé, like most of the Changing breeds, have a vulnerability to a particular metal tied to a spiritual aspect. However, they are weak to not only one but two metals. The first of these is Gold. Like the [[Corax]] the Mokolé are tied to the Sun, and thus are weak to this metal. However, the Mokolé born at night have maintained a tie between the Dragon Breed and Luna; and at any rate, the Mokolé are filled with [[Rage]], called Luna's Gift. Therefore, they are also vulnerable to Silver.
