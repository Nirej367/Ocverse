# Overview
---
Sources differ on why exactly the War of Rage started. All sources point to the Garou as being the aggressor. Some sources say they sought to make themselves the kingship of all [[Gaia]]'s children and force the other Changing-Breeds submit to their sole rule. Some Fera claim it is because the Garou demanded they show them secret powers granted them by Gaia that had not been meant for the Garou. There was not one single trigger for the War of Rage, but several circumstances that played into each other and resulted in massacres and genocide.

While some of the Fera are physically or spiritually more powerful in a one-on-one fight with the Garou, the werewolves had the advantage of fighting in packs. They picked off the solitary [[Fera]] one by one, driving some entire Breeds to extinction, like the [[Camazotz]].
