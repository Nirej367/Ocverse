**Fera**, also called _shifters_ or the _Changing Breeds_, are the races of shapeshifters of the World of Darkness. The term exclusively refers to those who undergo a proper [[First Change]] and excludes those who gain shapeshifting abilities via other means.

In addition to the names that each of the races have historically used for themselves (i.e. 'Garou', 'Ajaba', 'Corax', etc.), different shapeshifting races are distinguished (usually by outsiders) by more neutral terms simply describing the animal to which they share a form. These terms ("were(animal)" or sometimes "(animal)-shifter") also encompass shapeshifters of the appropriate animal who do not qualify as true Fera.

# Overview

While the [[Garou]] were created by [[Gaia]] as her fangs and claws, to keep her safe, they were not her only children. She created many other breeds of shapeshifters and gave them each a task. Some have lost their way with time; others were forced from their roles by the Garou. Some have turned to serving only one aspect of the [[Triat]], instead of Gaia as a whole.
