**Black Spiral Dancers** are one of the [[Tribe|tribes]] found. Also known as the [[Black Spiral Dancers|Lost Tribe]] the dreaded Black Spiral Dancers are the [[Garou]] who turned to the [[Wyrm]].
# Overview
---
After the end of the Impergium, the Wyrm began to stir, fed by humanity and growing to concerning proportions. The White Howlers plunged into what they believed to be the very lair of the Wyrm while in the throes of [[Rage]], hoping to rend the [[Triat|Triatic]] “beast” itself before it could grow too strong to be stopped. Instead, the White Howlers found themselves deep in the [[Black Spiral Labyrinth|Black Spiral]], taunted by entropic spiral mysteries. In their desperation, they sacrificed their [[Spirits#Patron Spirits| Patron Spirit]] [[Lion]] to the Wyrmish spirit [[Zotz]] in order to convince it to guide them out of the maze, but the damage had been done. The agonies of the Black Labyrinth, the death of Lion, and the White Howlers’ uncontrollable Rage had shattered them, and they acknowledged the Wyrm, in supplication to its might.

So died the White Howlers, and so emerged the Black Spiral Dancers in their stead: servants of ruin and followers of Bat. Tonight the Black Spiral Dancers remain Garou, but Wyrm-twisted aberrations of those things the Garou themselves hold dear. Their bodies have been tortured into shapes resembling bats, feral dogs, rats, and even things unspeakable, as much as they resemble wolves. And though they still possess the ability to change shape, as do Gaian Garou, those shapes are hideous and unnatural.
