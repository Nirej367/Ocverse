**Banes** are [[Spirits]] in service of the [[Wyrm]] in its modern role as the bringer of the Apocalypse. Other Wyrmish spirits exist which fulfil the Wyrm's purpose in a more sustainable and natural way, but those tend not to draw as much attention as the malevolent and destructive Banes, and are thus typically ignored.
