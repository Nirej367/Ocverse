Garou is a term used by the werewolves [[Fera|breed]] to identify their race and culture. The term is used nearly interchangeably with Garou Nation. 5th edition frequently uses the term to distinguish the eleven [[Tribes|tribes]] who are still willing to work with one another from other werewolves such as the [[Cult of Fenris]] and [[Black Spiral Dancers]], who have forsaken the title of Garou by turning their back on the Nation prior to its fall.
# Overview

According to their own mythology, the Garou were designed to be [[Gaia]]'s fangs and claws and they are quite adept at this. Today, after the [[War of Rage]], they are among the most numerous [[Fera|Changing Breeds]] that still exist.
