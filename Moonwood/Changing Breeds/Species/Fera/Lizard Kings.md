The **Lizard Kings**, also called **Dragon Kings** or **Dinosaur Kings**, and often simply referred to as "dragons", were the greatest of the reptiles, according to [[Mokolé]] lore. They ruled over a period known as the [[Age of Kings]], when dinosaurs walked the earth, but vanished during the Age of Sleep, after the Wonder-Work.
