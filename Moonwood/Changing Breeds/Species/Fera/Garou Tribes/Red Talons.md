![[Red Talons.png]]
The **Red Talons** are the only tribe among the [[Garou]] that is exclusively lupine in nature, shunning humanity completely as a blight on the Earth.
# Overview
---
 The Red Talons do accept human-born members, due to how rare wolf-born Garou are in the Era of Apocalypse, though they are still the only tribe in which the wolf-born make up a substantial fraction. However, they are still one of the most radical tribes, and they actively seek to curtail the influence of humankind over Gaia, sometimes going so far as to cull populations of humans where such a thing can be reasonably (to their perspectives) effected.

In the point of view of other werewolves from the now-shattered Garou Nation, the Red Talon perspective borders on the heretical. Red Talons often think that it isn’t the Wyrm that’s the imbalanced element of the [[Triat]], but rather the [[Weaver]], with its ever-expanding restrictiveness and malignant expansion in the form of cities, development, and “civilization.” Among the most extreme of Red Talons — even expressing such a sentiment is shameful — the [[Wyrm]] is a victim of the Weaver, and the Wyrm’s tools have their place.
