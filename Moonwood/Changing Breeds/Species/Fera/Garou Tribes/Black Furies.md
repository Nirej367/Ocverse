The **Black Furies** are one of the [[Tribes]]. The matriarchs of the [[Garou]], the Black Furies only accept women as members, and are known for their honor, wisdom, pride, and fierce skills in battle.
# Overview
---
Furies mistrust written records, seeing them as tainted from the [[Weaver]]'s webs. Thus they trust solely oral records passed on from mother to daughter. This makes much of their history more myth than certainty.

the Black Furies, now followers of [[Gorgon]], accept men and assigned-male-at-birth members as equals. Rather than concerning themselves predominantly with the social injustices of misogyny and sexism, the Furies bestow paramount importance on justice for the socially disadvantaged of all stripes and place no cause above or beneath any other (at least as a whole). The tribe is renowned for circumventing or shattering obstacles — whether a literal barrier, in the form of an enemy formation, or a “glass ceiling” that prevents fair outcomes.

That stated, their sobriquet continues to identify them as 'furies' with good cause. Even among Garou, the Black Furies have a reputation for escalation in situations where compromise would, in their opinion, yield only half-measures. At their best, the Black Furies want to set the balance right. Provoke them too greatly, however, and the Black Furies pursue justice _at all costs_.

To the Black Furies’ perspective, nothing is so despicable as those who are in positions of advantage and use it to harm the less fortunate. It’s a point of view that resonates greatly with the Garou service to Gaia, and thus are the Black Furies renowned as being among the most righteous (or self-righteous…) of all [[Garou]].

Their enthusiasm puts Black Furies at the forefront of many meaningful conflicts, whether the high-visibility, well-attended causes dear to the public, or the well-hidden, greenwashed, backroom deals where some unaware and unlucky soul is left holding the bag. Police brutality and wage inequalities, public-utility scams and yet another landfill full of consumer garbage — these events and others earn the ire of Black Furies looking to set things right. At the same time, righteousness can turn to hatred, and a Black Fury may have enemies for the sake of having enemies, even where none truly exist — a perilous risk when mixed with Garou politics and caern meetings.
