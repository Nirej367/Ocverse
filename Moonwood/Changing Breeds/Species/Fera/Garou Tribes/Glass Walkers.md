The **Glass Walkers** are one of the thirteen [[Tribes]] of [[Garou]]. Steeped in technology, human religion, and the ebb and flow of the city, the Glass Walkers live and die by a creed of progress. While they fear the Apocalypse as any werewolf, they believe that each passing day makes them stronger, that every new invention may be appropriated for their cause, and that every new philosophy might strengthen their resolve. In this way, Glass Walkers don't have the strong aversion to human populations that most Garou do.
