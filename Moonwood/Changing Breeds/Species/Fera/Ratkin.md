Ratkin are wererats, one of the [[Fera|Changing Breeds]] of the Classic World of Darkness.
# Overview
---
Like most of the Breeds, Ratkin were given a mission by [[Gaia]], and that mission was to control the human population by eating their food and spreading disease and pestilence. It worked until the [[Garou]] attempted to impose their dominance on the other Breeds in the so-called [[War of Rage]], and nearly drove the Ratkin to extinction. In the aftermath of the War, the Ratkin were forced into the margins of human society; however, because of the rapid urban growth, they recovered and once again are in ascendance. Ratkin are feral and brutal creatures, mainly because they are [[Wyld]]-touched, which means that not only can they frenzy like other shapeshifters, but also hallucinate in a state called Rapture.

Ratkin are still very distrustful of Garou even now, not least because one of their aspects was completely destroyed during the War of Rage - the Bards, equivalent of the Garou's Galliards. However, before the last Bards were slain, they foretold that in the final days the Ratkin would come back from their secret refuges.

More than any of the other Changing Breeds, Ratkin feel the touch of the Wyld. They believe the Weaver is just as insane (and as intent on destroying the world) as the Wyrm. Because of this, wererats are as likely to strike out against manifestations of the Weaver as at the Wyrm. The other Changing Breeds are blind to the true enemy and humanity has become its main pawn. As a result, the Ratkin are very hostile to humans and see them of little worth besides breedstock. Their dislike for humans has gone so far that they focus more and more on their animal kin, forsaking any ties to their other part and becoming more and more bestial.

In this way among many, the rat-shifters share many ideas with large parts of Garou society, including a belief that the Apocalypse is either imminent or has already arrived. They’re not interested in fighting it; they plan to outlast it. They snatch up [[Caern|spiritually powerful territories]] and turn them into nests, robbing them from other shifters if necessary. When it’s all over, and the [[Triat]] returns to normalcy — whatever that may be — the rat-shifters emerge as survivors, maybe even rulers.
