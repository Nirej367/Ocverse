**Nagah** are wereserpents, one of the surviving [[Fera|Changing Breeds]].
# Overview
---
Most of the [[Fera]] consider the Nagah to be extinct, wiped out in the [[War of Rage]]; this is according to their plans, for they act as [[Gaia]]'s "secret police", assassins and judges who target and eliminate those among the Fera who fall to corruption. The Nagah share the Garou's weakness against silver and their traits of [[Rage]] and [[Investiture|Gnosis]]. The Nagah have a strong affiliation to water, which is shown in their amphibious snake forms and their aquatic Ananata. Many [[Spirits]] that are in league with them have also ties to this element.

Like other Changing Breeds, the Nagah are heirs to an instinctive language peculiar to their kind alone. However, the Nagah’s speech (called simply “the Tongue”) is much less reliant on vocalization and more reliant on pheromone releases, body language, coil-shifting and the like. Thus, Nagah are able to communicate with one another even if the deaf Vasuki form. However, Nagah cannot communicate with ordinary serpents beyond the very basics of threat display and similar concepts; snakes simply don’t have the capacity for conversation.

The Nagah possess the best sensory abilities of human and snake - however, these abilities are often contradictory. A Nagah’s eyesight is passably accurate in all forms, and most Nagah have good color vision even in Vasuki form. As the Nagah moves along the scale from Balaram to Vasuki, his senses of smell and taste become more and more acute. Unfortunately, the Nagah also suffer from the hearing problems common to their serpent kin. Although a Nagah in Azhi Dahaka can hear about as well as an ordinary human, in Kali Dahaka, the form has poor hearing. In Vasuki form, a Nagah is deaf to any airborne sounds, and becomes reliant on his ability to sense vibrations and sound carried through solid objects.

The Nagah have access to a highly dangerous, fast poison that even affects leeches. In some cases, the Nagah may spit their venom in their opponents’ faces in order to blind them. In Vasuki or Kali Dahaka form, only Nagah of spitting cobra stock can attempt this, but the versatile fangs of the Azhi Dahaka make spitting venom a possibility for all wereseprents. The venom cannot affect spirits, even materialized spirits. Other Nagah are immune to Nagah venom.
