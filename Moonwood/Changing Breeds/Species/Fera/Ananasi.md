**Ananasi** are werespiders, one of the surviving [[Fera|Changing Breeds]] of the World Of Darkness. They call themselves _Damhàn_.
# Overview
---
The Damhàn consider themselves children of [[Weaver|Queen Ananasa]]. As creatures of the Weaver, they seek to keep true balance between the forces of the [[Triat]], fulfilling the Weaver's original purpose. Queen Ananasa's will is their law; she is the patron and of every Ananasi. The children of Queen Ananasa have many of the advantages of spiders. In all forms other than homid, they possess multiple pairs of eyes and limbs; they are also able to consciously exude pheromones, making it easy to attract mates. They possess poison glands (but their venom's potency varies according to the species of spider they resemble), and may also spin webs in _Pithus_ form which are tremendously strong.

Having no connection to [[Selene|Luna]], the Ananasi are one of the few Fera who do not possess [[Rage]]. Instead, like some of their spider kin, they are able to draw sustenance and supernatural power from the blood of humans and animals. They may expend the power granted by this blood to heal themselves, move with supernatural quickness, instantly change forms, create webs or to power some of their gifts. They do not regenerate like other Fera; they either heal at the same rate as humans, or they may use the power of the blood they have ingested to heal themselves. Similarly they do not enjoy the immunity to disease that Garou and other Fera possess, though they can purge such diseases from their system with the power in their blood.

The Damhàn do not step sideways to enter the [[Cognitive Realm|Umbra]]; instead, they assume _Crawlerling form_ (see below) and crawl through the strands of the web, which is how they think of the Gauntlet. Being creatures of the Weaver, they find this much easier in areas of high Weaver influence, and much more difficult in areas dominated by the [[Wyld]] or the [[Wyrm]]. They are are considered bizarre and alien at best by the other [[Fera|Changing Breeds]]; in return, the Ananasi consider the other Fera.
