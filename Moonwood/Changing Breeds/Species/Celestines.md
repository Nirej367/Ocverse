The Celestines are celestial [[Spirits|spirit]]s in the mythology of the [[Fera]]. Their power is equal to the ancient gods. They rule from the [[Spiritual Realm]] and are often worshiped by both the [[Garou]] and some [[Mundane|humans]].

A Celestine’s true form is unimaginable. They are both sentient and highly intelligent. Communication and communion between Celestines and lesser beings are only possible through [[Avatars]]. These avatars are aspects of themselves in guises lesser beings can understand. To create one, the Celestine merely wills itself to appear in a limited form; each Celestine is capable of maintaining multiple avatars at once. Each avatar contains a mere shard of the Celestine’s true power, although it still makes them among the most powerful beings in the spirit world.

Apart from this pair, however, there are other different Celestines; some are avatars of a member of the [[Triat]], while others are ancient spirits that humanity used to worship as gods.
