The **Spirit Wilds** are another name for the Middle [[Umbra]], particularly the space between the [[Near Realms]]. This part of the Umbra reflects the natural environment, both in its pristine state and the toxic, defiled mess its had become in modern nights. It is routinely visited by [[Garou]], though some mages also make regular visit here.
