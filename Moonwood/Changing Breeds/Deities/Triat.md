The **Triat** are three of the greatest entities in the [[Spirits|spiritual]] hierarchy: the [[Wyld]], the [[Weaver]], and the [[Wyrm]].
# Overview
---
In the mythology of the [[Garou]] and other [[Fera|changing breeds]], these three great spirits are responsible for the creation, preservation, and destruction of all things. As in most mythologies, there are multiple stories of the Triat, many contradictory. Opinions differ as to whether they created or were created by [[Gaia]], and whether all three were created at the one time, had always existed, or created each other in a specific order.
