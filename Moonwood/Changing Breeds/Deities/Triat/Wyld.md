The **Wyld** is one of the three spirits of the [[Triat]]. The Wyld is a generative force: it creates absolute Chaos, which is given order by the [[Weaver]] before it is destroyed and returned to chaos by the [[Wyrm]]. Where the other two of the Triat went insane, the Wyld is diminishing, being squashed out by the Weaver, and destroyed recklessly by the Wyrm.

[[Black Furies]] and [[Red Talons]] are the two foremost [[Garou]] tribes who celebrate the Wyld. Contrary to them, the [[Ratkin]] worship the Wyld as the supreme energy, well over [[Gaia]].
