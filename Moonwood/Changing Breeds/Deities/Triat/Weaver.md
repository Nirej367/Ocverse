**[[Weaver|Ananasa]]** is a [[Celestines|celestine|]] as well as her [[Spirits#Patron Spirits|patron spirit]], supreme queen of the [[Ananasi]].
# Overview
---
The [[Ananasi]] derive their name from Ananasa, and they serve her and her alone. Her agenda is to restore balance to the [[Triat]]. 

Its function was thought to be to make order from the creations of the [[Wyld]] giving them form and function for the duration of their existence before they were destroyed by the [[Wyrm]] maintaining a balance between creation and destruction.

Many [[Garou]] believe that the Weaver is primarily to blame for the imbalance in the Triat; their mythology states that the Weaver grew tired of its order being destroyed by the Wyrm, and spun its webs to imprison the Wyrm and end its destruction. This imprisonment drove the Wyrm mad, and caused it to begin destroying _everything_, rather than just those things whose time had ended.

The Weaver's avatars and children often take the form of spiders, or sometimes insects. It (or, more often, she) is a patron of law, order, science, and technology, and as such is revered by some semi-heretical [[Glass Walkers]] [[Ratkin]], and [[Ananasi]]. Most realize, however, that the Weaver is far too powerful in the modern world, where cities and steel are more important and influential than nature.

Mankind is Weaver's adopted child, in order to bring order to the world and help her to end the chaos that her Celestine brethren constantly wrought upon creation. To this end, Weaver implanted [[Mundane|mortals]] with three gifts, Dogma, Science, and Technology, in order to survive.

The Weaver has three incarnation: the manifestation of her gift of Technology, the manifestation of Dogma, and the manifestation of Science.
