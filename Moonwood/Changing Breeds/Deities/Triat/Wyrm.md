The Wyrm is one of the three incalculably [[Celestines|powerful]] [[Spirits|spirits]] comprising the [[Triat]].
# Overview
---
In the theology of the [[Garou]], the Wyrm is one of the higher [[Celestines]]. The Wyrm's purpose was to cleanse and rectify all of Creation, furthering its descent into Entropy. It achieved this by eliminating that which the [[Wyld]] creates and the [[Weaver|Weaver]] structures, completing the eternal cycle of birth to death.

The form that the Wyrm takes in its aspect as harbinger of the Apocalypse is often called the 'Wyrm ascendant', or more generically the 'Apocalypse Wyrm', rather than the Triatic Wyrm. Never imprisoned and maddened by the Weaver, the Wyrm was instead driven to uncontainable hunger by the rampant greed and defilement that [[Humans|humanity]] enacted upon itself and [[Gaia]] of its own volition, rather than the other way around as presented in older editions. Human greed has upset the cosmological balance, and now the spirit world reflects the [[Physical Realm|physical world]]’s trends of destruction, extraction and ruin — so long as profit can be derived from it.

In the Era of Apocalypse more so than any other time in history, the Triat is imbalanced, with the Wyrm now ascendant, emboldened and empowered by consumption and exploitation, and thus fueling the cycle. Their [[Rage]] incited, [[Garou]] despise the fact that rampant, unmoderated consumption “feeds the Wyrm,” forcing the world into an ever-greater despair, which drives humans to seek more comfort via consumption, changing the Triatic cycle instead into a downward spiral with only one logical conclusion. To many Garou, that conclusion is inevitable. What they must not do, though, is simply accept it. 

The Wyrm doesn’t itself cause exploitation or turn people to greed. The Wyrm ascendant is a manifestation of greed, not the origin of it. Humans are responsible for their own actions and choices. But, certainly, greed and exploitation strengthen the Wyrm, and the fundamental insatiability of greed means that once the Wyrm strengthens, it continues to strengthen.
# Creatures of the Wyrm

The Wyrm counts many among its servants. Some serve knowingly, some unknowingly. But their actions all serve the Wyrm's greater purpose of bringing about the Apocalypse; the end of [[Gaia]]. As such, all creatures who cause misery, indulge in depravity and/or partake in destruction, either willingly or unwillingly, knowingly or unknowingly, are servants of the Wyrm and are considered deserving of death and damnation by the [[Fera]].
