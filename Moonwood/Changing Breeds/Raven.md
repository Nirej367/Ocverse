Raven is a [[Spirits|Spirit]] that greatly supports the [[Corax]].
# Overview
---
Raven is the cleverest bird, though not clever enough to keep that fact to himself. He feeds without hunting, following wolves or bringing them to dead animals so they can feed. He teaches wisdom by taunting cubs into trying to catch the uncatchable bird. Raven watches the world, ever hungry for new secrets. His knowledge makes him a totem of wealth â€” if werewolves trust in him, Raven will provide.
