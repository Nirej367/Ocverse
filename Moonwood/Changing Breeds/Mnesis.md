**Mnesis**, also called _the Memory_ by the [[Mokolé]], is a peculiar [[Investiture|Gnosis]] possessed only by werereptiles, including the Mokolé themselves and rare cases among the [[Nagah]]. This ability drives the core purpose dedicated to preserving knowledge. Since the memories do not degrade with time, it is perfect for the collection of enormous quantities of facts. 

Mokolé often create "index" to find individual pieces of information much faster. When one stores a memories, it immediately disappears from their own memory (although it can be stored at partial strength to allow them to keep a vague recollection, at the cost of the stored memory being weaker).

Memories stored are filed individually and are not seen as one whole reserve to the Mokolé. The longer a memory sits outside where it resides, the more it degrades, though this is due to the brain's own imperfections rather than a result of the magic. As such, Mokolé undergo extensive training in memory retention to keep them as pristine as possible. They cannot store muscle memory.
