**Corax** are one of the [[Fera|changing breeds]].They are wereravens.
# Overview

The Corax animal form is that of a raven (_corvus corax_), and they take to their role as scouts, spies, and gossips with zeal. They are one of the few, if not the only, groups of shifters still on good terms with the [[Garou]] after the [[War of Rage]].

Corax are well known for flying, talking (and talking, and talking...), performing practical jokes on deserving Garou, and swooping down from the sky to nab dimes and tin foil. Most of all, they have a reputation for knowing things. Wanderlust, wings, and the breed's well-known inability to shut up enable to Corax to report their finding to one another as well as the local Garou and other authorities.

Corax do have [[Rage]], but they rarely develop it and are not known for the kind of violent outbursts that plague the Garou. They begin life with more [[Investiture|Gnosis]] than most Garou, though they are usually forced to barter favors and information for access to [[Caern]]s. While Corax are able to breed with humans or ravens, new Corax are only created by the [[Rite of the Fetish Egg]]. This ritual is very taxing to the parent and will automatically fail if attempted on the child of two Corax.

All Corax have [[Raven]] as a [[Spirits#Patron Spirits|Patron Spirits]] and their bond with [[Helios]] is similar to the one shared between the [[Garou]] and [[Selene|Luna]]. They adore shiny and sparkly things.
