Camazotz were werebats, one of the extinct [[Fera|Changing Breeds]].
# Overview
---
Few among the Fera remember the Camazotz, though the [[Mokolé]] keep their memory alive through [[Mnesis]] They recall that the Camazotz were [[Gaia]]'s other messengers, counterparts of the [[Corax]] who flew through the night and the southern lands which did not have ravens.

The relationship between [[Zotz]] and the Camazotz was stronger than that between most Fera and their spirit fathers. Bat loved his children with all his heart, knowing only too well of the burden to remain mistrusted and shunned by his cousins. He lavished gifts and advice upon the Camazotz, even going so far as teaching them a special kind of blood magic after the European Camazotz were exterminated by the [[Garou]] during the [[War of Rage]].

When his children were nearly exterminated, Bat's mind cracked and he reemerged with a split personality, one in the service of Gaia and one in the service of the Wyrm. As far as most Garou know, he has fallen entirely into the thrall of the Wyrm. However, like the deity revered by the Mayan cultures so long ago, Bat appears to have a dual aspect – in some respects he is still of the Wyrm, but in others, he has come back to Gaia. Most Garou don’t know what to make of this, and look on Bat’s followers with great suspicion. None of them seem to be corrupt, but that doesn’t make them innocent.

For their part, Bat’s children have deep ties to the earth unmatched by those of other Garou. They listen to the voices of the Camazotz, and are making a sincere effort to continue that lost Breed’s work. The Voice of Gaia sings through them, and they listen to Her voice so that they can find Her enemies and destroy them.
# Culture

The Camazotz gifts of speed, stealth, and heightened perception made them excellent spies who would keep what they discovered between their allies and [[Gaia]]. One of their strengths, as well as one of the major reasons that the [[Garou]] feared them, was that it was exceptionally difficult to know if one of the Camazotz was listening to a conversation.

# Skills and Abilities
---
Blood Rituals are a class of ritual specific to the Camazotz. The ritemaster must spill her own blood as part of the ritual, suffering one level of lethal damage. This damage does not heal until the ritual's effects end.
## [[Crimson Rites]]

Gaia's greatest gift to the [[Fera|Changing Breeds]] was their ability to recover from any wound. Broken bones and gushing lacerations could not kill one of Gaia's chosen. During the First War of Rage, the Garou seemed unstoppable thanks to their inexhaustible rage and healing abilities. [[Zotz]] taught its children how to deny the [[Garou]] and other [[Fera|supernatural creatures]] their healing abilities. Afraid that this rite might fall into the claws of the [[Wyrm]], teachers were reluctant to share it except with their most trusted disciples. The Camazotz who mastered this rite could make their enemies as weak as humans. 

As part of the ritual, blood must be paid to infuse their claws with elemental energy.
