Few among the Fera remember the Camazotz, though the [[Mokolé]] keep their memory alive through [[Mnesis]] They recall that the Camazotz were [[Gaia]]'s other messengers, counterparts of the [[Corax]] who flew through the night and the southern lands which did not have ravens.

The relationship between [[Zotz]] and the Camazotz was stronger than that between most Fera and their spirit fathers. Bat loved his children with all his heart, knowing only too well of the burden to remain mistrusted and shunned by his cousins. He lavished gifts and advice upon the Camazotz, even going so far as teaching them a special kind of blood magic after the European Camazotz were exterminated by the [[Garou]] during the [[War of Rage]].

When his children were nearly exterminated, Bat's mind cracked and he reemerged with a split personality, one in the service of Gaia and one in the service of the Wyrm. As far as most Garou know, he has fallen entirely into the thrall of the Wyrm. However, like the deity revered by the Mayan cultures so long ago, Bat appears to have a dual aspect – in some respects he is still of the Wyrm, but in others, he has come back to Gaia. Most Garou don’t know what to make of this, and look on Bat’s followers with great suspicion. None of them seem to be corrupt, but that doesn’t make them innocent.

For their part, Bat’s children have deep ties to the earth unmatched by those of other Garou. They listen to the voices of the Camazotz, and are making a sincere effort to continue that lost Breed’s work. The Voice of Gaia sings through them, and they listen to Her voice so that they can find Her enemies and destroy them.
