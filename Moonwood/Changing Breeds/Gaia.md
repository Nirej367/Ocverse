**Gaia** is the Earth in both a [[Physical Realm|physical]] and a [[Spiritual Realm|spiritual sense]]; the Mother Goddess of all living things.
# Overview
---
Gaia is greater than a [[Celestines]], and one of the most powerful [[Celestines|spirits]] known to exist – possibly the first, and most powerful. She is credited with creating the [[Garou]] and most of the [[Fera]] to serve as her warriors and agents both in the [[Physical Realm|material]] and [[Cognitive Realm|spirit worlds]].

Beyond the [[Triat]], she more clearly has ties to [[Helios]] and [[Selene|Luna]]. As is the case with other spirits of God-like power, Gaia is almost never encountered directly; instead she communicates with her children and other supplicants via minor spirits under her command.

Gaia cannot be contacted directly, and resides within the [[Moonwood|Summer Country]], blissfully dreaming of life.
