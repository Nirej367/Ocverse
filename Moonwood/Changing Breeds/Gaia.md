**Gaia** is the [[Earth]] and related Realms, in both a physical and a spiritual sense; the Mother Goddess of all living things.
# Overview
---
Gaia is greater than a [[Celestine]], and one of the most powerful [[Spirit|spirits]] known to exist – possibly the first, and most powerful. She is credited with creating the [[Garou]] and most of the [[Fera]] to serve as her warriors and agents both in the [[Physical Realm|material]] and [[Umbra|spirit worlds]].

Beyond the [[Triat]], she more clearly has ties to [[Helios]] and [[Luna]]. While [[Mage|mages]] generally see her as 'merely' a spiritual representation of the planet Earth, Garou and others often think of her as the entire cosmos, with the planet as just her most important and vital aspect.

As is the case with other spirits of God-like power, Gaia is almost never encountered directly; instead she communicates with her children and other supplicants via minor spirits under her command.

Gaia cannot be contacted directly, and resides within the [[Moonwood|Summer Country]], blissfully dreaming of life.
