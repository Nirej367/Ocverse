The crimson rites is a peculiar [[Investiture|Magic]] only used by the [[Camazotz]] until the [[War of Rage]]. It is unknown how to use it at the moment.
# Overview
---
[[Zotz]] taught its children how to deny the [[Garou]] and other [[Fera|supernatural creatures]] their healing abilities. As part of the ritual, blood must be paid to infuse their claws with elemental energy. The Camazotz who mastered this rite could make their enemies as weak as humans. However, afraid that this rite might fall into the claws of the [[Wyrm]], teachers were reluctant to share it except with their most trusted disciples.

It is because of the crimson rites that most of the Camazotz were exterminated. The [[Wyrm]] was able to interfere with the innate magic of this werebeast. [[Black Spiral Dancers]] were tough how to use it against their fellow [[Fera]] so they could kill them all and fulfill their master desires.

After all [[Camazotz]] went extinct, [[Zotz]] was left badly hurt. The Wyrm took advantage of this opportunity to seize him and take away their secrets. Nowadays, no one knows this magic, no even the [[Black Spiral Dancers]]. The users were murdered after the [[War of Rage]] by their master. It is unknown why he's holding back this kind of magic from his people.
