The **First Change** is the name for the first shapeshifting of a young [[Garou]] (and for most [[Fera]]). Usually it comes along with the first [[Rage|frenzy]] and the first usage of the crinos battle-form in highly stressful situations. At some times however, the change can be more placid and straightforward, as the shapeshifter melds into another form.
