**Rite of the Fetish Egg** is a rite practiced exclusively by the [[Corax]] to create new members of their species.
# Overview
---
Unlike the other [[Fera]], the Corax cannot produce new Corax sexually. Instead, they use this rite to create a "spirit egg" and bind it to a human or raven child. The Rite is not to be taken lightly; it requires a witness, four hours of time, and permanent [[Investiture|Gnosis]] to complete, and must be performed in the [[Cognitive Realm|Umbra]].

Even if the Rite succeeds, the egg must then remain unharmed and attached to the child until that creature's [[First Change]]. The destruction of the egg ruins the Rite and wastes the Gnosis, in addition to causing psychological problems such as depression in both child and "parent", respectively.
