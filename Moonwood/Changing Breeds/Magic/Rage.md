**Rage** is a [[Investiture|mystical wellspring]] of primal anger granted to some [[Fera]], specifically the [[Garou]]. It allows them to move at great speed, shrug off mighty wounds, and change forms quickly.
# Overview
---
Rage increases physical strength, speed, durability, balance, and enhanced ability to heal. It allows the user to push their body far past what they would normally be able to achieve. Is not simply from the increased strength or speed, as it also enhances the body's natural balance, granting almost unnaturally smooth movements. It also increases reaction speed and gives the user resistance to hot and cold temperatures. Finally, it increases endurance, letting the body continue on long past when it would have normally shut down. A [[Fera]] having just survived a deadly wound can die from the resulting effects when the body runs out of rage.
