**Demons**, occasionally known as the _akathartoi_ ("unclean ones") to distinguish them from other entities often called demons, are spiritual entities that originate from the enigmatic domain of [[Hell]], a place of horror and indescribable evil that even the native demons hate to exist within. This leads them to constantly attempt at escaping, while also trying to damn the souls of the living and alter the material world to fit their idea of paradise.

Demons are organized in an infernal hierarchy, similar to [[Spirits]] and their choirs. Similar to spirits, they advance in their hierarchy by fulfilling their purpose, in most cases spreading sin and ruining lives.
