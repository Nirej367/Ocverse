Investiture, along with matter and energy, is one of the three essences that make up the world. Investiture can be considered a kind of Spiritual energy. While everything has an Invested component in the [[Spiritual Realm]], known as a [[Spiritweb]], that Investiture is usually inaccessible. Magic systems provide the most common access to Investiture, which allows people to commit incredible feats using the power.
