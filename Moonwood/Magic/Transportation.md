The [[Investiture|Gnosis]] of Transportation can be manipulated to achieve realmatic transition. Using this ability enables to briefly look into theÂ [[Cognitive Realm]] which allows them to see hidden essences of others.

This ability allows to travel between the [[Cognitive Realm|Cognitive]] and [[Physical Realm]]s by creating a miniature stepway, called Elsegates. The caster can also bring other beings and objects with them while transporting themselves. This surge is incredibly difficult to master. It's much harder to leave the Cognitive Realm than it is to enter it, and although it is possible to transition realms without a waypoint, those that are less skilled need to find a point where the two Realms touch to be able to leave.
