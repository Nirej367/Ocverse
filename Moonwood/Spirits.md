**Spirits** are disembodied entities that originate in, and usually dwell in, the [[Cognitive Realm|Umbra]] - for that reason, some [[Mage]]s call them the "**Umbrood**".
# Overview
---
These beings are primarily encountered by [[Garou]] and certain types of mages, although numerous other supernatural beings are capable of discerning or even interacting with the [[Cognitive Realm|spirit world]]. Mages use the term Umbrood as an umbrella term for spirits.

Patron Spirits are spirits, who offer to grant boons to followers in the [[Physical Realm|material world]] in exchange for adhering to their bans and agendas. The term 'Patron Spirit' is typically used to refer to those spirits who offer their patronage to entire tribes of [[Garou]], but other Patron Spirits exist who grant boons to non-Garou organizations, or who offer support to individuals or smaller groups, as is the case with Pack Patrons and the patrons of individual caerns. These smaller-scale patronages are the most likely to involve a Patron Spirit below Incarnae in the spirit hierarchy.
