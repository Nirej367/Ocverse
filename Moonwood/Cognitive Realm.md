The Cognitive Realm is the world of thought and perception, in which the Cognitive aspects of all things become manifest. It is known locally as The [[Cognitive Realm|Umbra]], though at least some [[Garou]] have taken to using the term to refer to the entire Realm. A planet's reflection in the Cognitive Realm is referred to as a subastral.

The nature and appearance of objects in this Realm are shaped by the views of people and even the objects themselves. The environment itself changes from one world to the next, often exhibiting features characteristic of that world. Magic, including that within souls, glows visibly within the Cognitive Realm.

While time appears to flow normally, space is warped by perception. Due to this, the Physical and Cognitive Realms do not perfectly align, and vertical distance is significantly contracted. [[Transportation|Traveling]] between the Physical and the Cognitive Realms may be accomplished by the Gorou intuitively once the [[First Change]] passes.

Planets within the Cognitive Realm are distorted into a flat plane, though it is unclear which projection it makes use of in this distortion.
