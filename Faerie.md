# Characteristics
---
All Changelings are born to humans. Before they realize their heritage, they live in a half-reality, catching glimpses of the Dreaming that never fully realize themselves until the prospective Changeling experience the [[Chrysalis]].
## Aging
---
Once, the fae were immortal and unrestricted from the passage of time. With the beginning of the Shattering, fae in mortal bodies learned that they aged like humans did and would eventually die if no preparations were made. The Seeming often reflects their actual age, but not necessarily.

By remaining within a [[Freehold]], changelings can avoid aging. Doing so, however, carries the danger of insanity and Bedlam. Older Changelings therefor play a dangerous game in how long they can stay inside a freehold and how long they can survive exposure to the banal world. If they play their cards right, Changelings can outlive mortals by centuries. Often that can mean changelings need to [[Changeling Death|abandon their mortal lives]] at some point.
